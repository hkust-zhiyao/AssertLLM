The AdvancedWatchpointControl program is a Java-language program distributed
as an Eclipse project.  These instructions assume you have both the
Eclipse platform and the JDT Java development plugins installed.  These
instructions were written for Eclipse version 3.5.2, though other versions
should be similar.

To build the project in Eclipse, you must first import it into your workspace.  
From the 'File' menu, select 'Import...'. In the Import menu, under the 
'General' folder, select 'Existing Projects into Workspace', then click 'Next'.
On the next screen, select 'Select root directory', then enter (or browse to) 
the adv_debug_sys/Software/AdvancedWatchpointControl directory.  Finally, 
click the 'Finish' button to import the project.

AdvancedWatchpointControl depends on the SWT GUI widget toolkit from the
Eclipse project.  This can be downloaded directly from the Eclipse project,
at http://www.eclipse.org/swt/.  Download the version appropriate for your
operating system.

There are (at least) two ways to satisfy the dependancy on SWT.  As shipped,
AdvancedWatchpointControl is configured to depend on a project in the
workspace called org.eclipse.swt  To create this project, you may import the
SWT project into the workspace from the downloaded archive file in the same
way you imported AdvancedWatchpointControl.

In some versions of the SWT archive, there is a bug which prevents Eclipse
from importing the project.  If this is the case, you must work around.
Extract the SWT archive, and find the swt.jar file.  In Eclipse, right-click
on the AdvancedWatchpointControl, and click on 'Properties.'  Under the
'Projects' tab, remove the dependancy on org.eclipse.swt.  Under the
'Libraries' tab, remove SWT_CONTAINER/PLATFORM.  Then click the 'Add 
External JARs...' button.  This will open the 'JAR Selection' dialog.  Select
the swt.jar file from the archive, and click OK.

You should now be able to build AdvancedWatchpointControl, and run it as a
Java application via the Eclipse GUI.

If you do not have or wish to install Eclipse, a simple Makefile has been
included which should be able to build AdvancedWatchpointControl as an
executable JAR file.  Simply type "make" in the project's root directory
to build the program, which will be called AdvancedWatchpointControl.jar.
Typing "make run" will build the program, then execute it.

A pre-compiled executable JAR file has been included in the root directory of
AdvancedWatchpointControl, called AdvancedWatchpointControl.jar.  To run this
file using the Sun JVM in Linux, use the command line:

>java -jar AdvancedWatchpointControl.jar

Other JVMs and operating systems may use different syntax.  Note that the
AdvancedWatchpointControl.jar file includes the SWT library, which is
distributed under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0.  A copy of
this license may be found in the doc/ subdirectory.
