Thanks to R. Diez for contributing the autotools support patch:

./autogen.sh
./configure
./make
./make install

The autogen.sh script only needs to be run once after the initial
checkout. The configure script only needs to be run before the
first build, or when changing build options. Note that a 'make
clean' should also be done when changing build options.

Note that there are many options. The defaults match a typical use
scenario, and the defaults of the adv_dbg_if hardware. Type
"./configure --help" to get a list of all the options. The options
are also described in more detail in the BUILDING.classic file,
and to some extent in the adv_jtag_bridge documentation.
