This folder provides several *alternative* TOP ENTITIES of the NEO430 processor.


Default Top Entity:
---------------------------------------------------------------
 The default entity of the processor is rtl\core\neo430_top.vhd. That entity propagates ALL signals
 to the outer world and features a Wishbone bus interface. The type of all entity ports is
 *std_ulogic* / *std_ulogic_vector*.


Test Setup Top Entity:
---------------------------------------------------------------
 If you want to have a quick setup (that is also used for the implementation tutorial in the
 project's documentary) you can use the *neo430_test.vhd* as top entity. This entity only propagates
 a minimal set of signals to the outer world (8 GPIO output signals and the UART lines). The test
 setup is intended to be some kind of "hello world" demo.


Top Entity with Avalon Memory Mapped Master:
---------------------------------------------------------------
 *still experimental*

 If you want to use the Avalon bus protocol instead of the default Wishbone bus connectivity, you
 can use the *neo430_top_avm.vhd* as top entity. This unit provides the same ports as the default top
 entity, but it implements an Avalon-compatible master interface instead of a Wishbone master interface.

 From a software point of view, the Avalon bus interface is used by calling the default Wishbone transfer
 functions, since the native Wishbone interface is internally transformed to Avalon by a simple
 combinatorial bridging logic.

 Note: This setup also uses std_logic and std_logic_vector as port signal types to be compatible with
 Quartus QSYS.


Top Entity with AXI4-Lite Memory Mapped Master:
---------------------------------------------------------------

 The *neo430_top_axi4lite.vhd* top entity converts the processor's Wishbone bus to an AXI4-lite master compatible
 interface. From a software point of view, the AXI4-lite interface is used by calling the default Wishbone
 transfer functions.

 Note: This setup also uses std_logic and std_logic_vector as port signal types.
